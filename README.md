# Hangman
In order to run the program you need javafx library and you need to add it from project structure
You need to add module path from edit configurations//vm options/path

This is a regular hangman program.
You cannot type anything but letters.
The comparison ignores case sensitivity.
A letter cannot be tried twice or more
When all the letters are revealed winner screen pops up
When all the body parts are revealed the loser screen pops up
